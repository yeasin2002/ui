# Product Overview

shadcn/ui is a collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable UI components built with React, Tailwind CSS, and Radix UI. It's not a traditional component library - instead, it's a registry system that allows developers to copy and paste component code directly into their projects.

## Core Concept

Components are not installed as npm dependencies. Instead, users run a CLI tool (`shadcn`) that copies component source code into their project, giving them full ownership and control to customize as needed.

## Key Features

- **Component Registry System**: Components are organized in a registry with multiple styles (Vega, Nova, Maia, Lyra, Mira) and bases (Radix, Base UI)
- **Design System Configurability**: Supports themes, base colors, fonts, icon libraries, and radius presets
- **CLI Tool**: The `shadcn` package provides commands to initialize projects and add components
- **Documentation Site**: The v4 app serves as both documentation and a showcase for components
- **Open Source**: Users can view, copy, and modify all component source code

## Target Audience

Developers who want high-quality, accessible UI components with full control over the code, rather than being locked into a package dependency.
