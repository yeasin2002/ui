# shadcn/ui

A collection of beautifully designed, accessible, and customizable React components built on top of Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS.

## Purpose

- Provides copy-paste ready UI components that developers own and can customize
- Not a traditional component library - components are added directly to your project
- Includes a CLI (`shadcn`) for adding components to projects
- Documentation website at ui.shadcn.com

## Key Concepts

- **Registry System**: Components are distributed via a registry that the CLI fetches from
- **Design System Config**: Supports multiple bases (Radix, Base UI), styles (Vega, Nova, Maia, Lyra, Mira), themes, and icon libraries
- **CSS Variables**: Theming via CSS custom properties for colors, radius, etc.
- **Composable**: Components are built to be composed together and extended
